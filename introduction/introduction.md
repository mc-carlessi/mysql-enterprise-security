# Introduction

## About this Workshop

Securing the data stored in your MySQL Server is key towards avoiding breaches and achieving Regulatory Compliance.  This workshop covers the installation, configuration and testing of 4 of the MySQL Security Based Enterprise Features.  We will go through how to setup and run Enterprise Audit, Enterprise Transparent Data Encryption, Enterprise FireWall and Enterprise Data Masking.

Estimated Workshop Time: 1 hours 30 minutes (This estimate is for the entire workshop - it is the sum of the estimates provided for each of the labs included in the workshop.)

Your Free Tier server should be accessible for a couple of days after this workshop so what you do not finish when following instruction will be able to be covered later at your own pace.
